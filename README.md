Welcome To MidStream CLI Application

MidStream CLI is an application that will allow midstream users to look up
and manage there contracts with producers and purchasers of various fuels
and crude oil that are available worldwide through there distribution channels.

To use Midstream CLI Application you must first register. You will be directed
to input a user name and a password. Once you register you will have access to
view all the fuels and crude that are available from a list of producers worldwide
and create a contract immediately and lock in your price for future deliveries.
You will be able to see the current pricing and the amount that is immediately
liftable and the amount the producer has available on future production.

MidStream CLI also gives you the ability to create a contract immediately with a
purchaser with fuel or crude that you have available also by choosing from a list
of purchaser and desired locations worldwide with pricing and delivery dates

been made with your producers and purchases. You can look them up by all the
contracts which will list all your past and future contracts or you can just
look up a list of future contracts with the producers and purchasers.

Our CLI demonstrates object relationships of many to many with 2 sets of three
classes the first set is of producer contracts, midstream, and producers. In
which the midstream class has many producers through producer contract class,
and producer class has many midstreams through producer contracts class as well.
The other set of classes of  purchaser contracts, midstream and purchasers class
have the same relationship as above.
